        <p>Hi I'm Scott! I am 42 years old and I live in Southern California with my awesome wife
            and four awesome kids. I am a Quality Assurance Lead at a place called <a
              href="https://www.magnopus.com">Magnopus</a>.
            I love frisbee, music, video games, hiking, drawing, playing guitar, playing with my
            kids, driving down the coast at sunset and lots of other stuff! I served my mission in
            the Georgia, Atlanta and then the Georgia Atlanta North Missions from 2002 to 2004. I
            love Georgia and I miss it.
            I had cancer when I was 14 and I lived with an internal prosthetic until January 2024
            when I finally cut off my leg and starting using a external prosthetic. My life has
            improved immensely ever since!</p>

            <p>Southern California is a wonderful place to live. It is sandwiched between the
                mountains
                and the ocean.
                It is a pretty busy place, but there is always something to do. Southern California
                is known for its mostly laid back culture. It is also the home of Disneyland,
                California Adventure and Knott's Berry Farm. </p>
